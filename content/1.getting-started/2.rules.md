1. **Commission Cap**: The maximum commission is set at 10%.
2. **Governance Participation**: Validators must have a governance participation score of 60% or higher. 0/0 will be considered 100% score. First three proposals (#1, #2 and #3) and spam proposals (#28, #30) will not be considered.
   - Calculation: Number of proposals voted on by the validator divided by the total number of proposals during the validator's active period.
3. **Penalties for Misconduct**:
   - Soft Slash: One soft slash allowed per epoch; a second soft slash results in losing the delegation for the next epoch.
   - Hard Slash: Any hard slash results in losing the delegation for six months.
4. **Exclusion Right**: The DAO can exclude validators from the program for proven harmful behavior.
5. **Single Organization Limitation**: Only one delegation per organization is allowed.
