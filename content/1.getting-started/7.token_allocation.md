title: Token Allocation

The BTSG tokens dedicated to the Delegation Program will be managed by the Bitsong Delegation DAO through the DAODAO platform. 
This ensures transparency and decentralized control over the allocation process, allowing for community-driven decision-making.

## Example Calculation
- **Validator A**: Uptime 99.5% (750 points), ecosystem participation (0 points), community project (1400 points), archive node (75 points), public rpc/api (50 points), separate public rpc/api (950 points) = Total 3225 points.
  - Multiplier: 0.5 => Final Score: 1612.5 points

- **Validator B**: Uptime 99.9% (950 points), ecosystem participation (2000 points), self-stake 90% commission (900 points) = Total 3850 points.
  - Multiplier: 0.55 => Final Score: 2117.5 points

- **Validator C**: Uptime 99.9% (950 points), self-stake 50% commission (500 points), self-delegation 50% (500 points) = Total 1950 points.
  - Multiplier: 0.9 => Final Score: 1755 points

- **Validator D**: Uptime 99.9% (950 points), core development (2600 points), community explorer (1500 points), two relayers (2700 points), self-stake 30% commission (300 points) = Total 8550 points.
  - Multiplier: 0.41 => Final Score: 3591 points

**Total Points of All Validators**: 1612.5 + 2117.5 + 1755 + 3591 = 9076 points

**Delegation Shares**:

- Validator A: 17.77%
- Validator B: 23.33%
