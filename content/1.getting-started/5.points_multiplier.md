title: Points Multiplier
description: a mechanism to distribute rewards based on validator's performance
---

A multiplier is applied based on the validator's current voting power (excluding Bitsong DP) ranging from 0.01x to 1x. The lowest ranked validator receives a 1x multiplier, and the highest ranked receives a 0.01x multiplier.

## Assigned Delegation Based on Points

Validators' total points (after applying multipliers) determine their share of the Bitsong delegation. The share is proportional to their score relative to the total score of all participants.
