---

The Bitsong Delegation Program is evaluated and distributed every three months. This ensures a dynamic, transparent, and efficient process, encouraging comprehensive contributions from validators.

Valuations and scores will be published at the beginning of the Epoch, right before distribution.

## Management of Token Allocation
The BTSG tokens dedicated to the Delegation Program will be managed by the Bitsong Delegation DAO through the DAODAO platform. 
This ensures transparency and decentralized control over the allocation process, allowing for community-driven decision-making.
