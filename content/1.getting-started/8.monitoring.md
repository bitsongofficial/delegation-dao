description: monitoring and grace period for issue
---

To maintain service quality and reliability, the following protocol will be in place:
- **Monitoring**: All services provided by participants will be monitored by Delegation DAO. If any service goes down, the participant will be notified.
- **Grace Period**: Participants will have a 7-day grace period to resolve issues such as IP changes or DNS updates. The service must be back online within this period.
- **Response and Action**:
   - If the service operator does not respond or take action within the 7-day period, the delegation may be withdrawn.
   - If the operator responds and requests more time due to unforeseen circumstances, additional time may be granted at the discretion of the Delegation DAO.
